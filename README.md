# Enigma (in construction)

A reconstruction of the Enigma Machine using ReactJs.

## Summary

The [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) is a cipher
device developed during the WWII era and used by Nazi Germany for communication
in its millitary throughout the war.

It was a very intricate device during its time. It took a lot of effort from the
allies to crack its code with the help of brilliant individuals such as
[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) and the team at
[Bletchley Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park).

This project aims to create a user interface which replicates the original
machine and its variants in order for me, and hopefully other people to
understand the device better.
